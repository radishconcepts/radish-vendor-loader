# Radish Vendor Loader
This enables WordPress to load plugins from the `vendor-plugins` directory, which can then be ignored in the version control system.

## Credits
This plugin is based on the [WP-Plugin-Directories plugin](https://github.com/chrisguitarguy/WP-Plugin-Directories) by Christopher Davis, Franz Josef Kaiser and Julien Chaumond, but has been changed to support our own workflow better.
